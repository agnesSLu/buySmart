## Getting Started

To begin development, execute one of the following commands to run the server in your terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
The development server will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Editing the page
Start customizing the main page by modifying the file located at app/page.js. Your changes will automatically reflect on the page as you edit the file.

## API Routes
Explore API functionality at http://localhost:3000/api/hello. The corresponding endpoint can be modified in pages/api/hello.js. The pages/api directory is designated for API routes and differs from regular React pages.

## Font Optimization
This project efficiently manages fonts using next/font, ensuring automatic optimization and loading of the Inter fontâ€”a custom Google Font.
